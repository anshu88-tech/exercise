# Stuffsus — Shop Page (Bootstrap)

This small static project recreates the shop page layout from the provided design using HTML and Bootstrap 5.

Files added:

- `index.html` — Main page. Open in a browser to view the shop layout.
- `assets/css/styles.css` — Custom styling to approximate the visual design.

How to run

1. Open `d:\SHOP\index.html` in your browser (double-click or use "Open File").
2. No build or server required — the page uses Bootstrap from CDN and placeholder images.

Notes

- Images are placeholders (via placeholder.com and Unsplash). Replace with real product images in `index.html` if you have them.
- The layout is responsive and uses Bootstrap grids. Feel free to tweak spacing in `assets/css/styles.css`.

If you want, I can:

- Convert this into a small React/Vue app with JSON-driven products.
- Add a simple script to generate product cards from a JSON file.
